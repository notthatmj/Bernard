# Fantasy-Name-Generator

I play tabletop roleplaying games, and usually I act as the gamemaster. In such
games, it's the gamemasters job to present stories to the players. Often, this
involves coming up with many character names that sound appropriate in the
context of a medieval fantasy setting. This app is designed to help with that
task. It lets the user randomly generate such names, mark her favorites, and
quickly share the list of favorites.

This is an educational project. It's intended to help me improve my iOS
development skills, with an emphasis on learning Swift.
